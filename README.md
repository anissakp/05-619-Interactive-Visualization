# Pittsburgh Air Quality Visualizations

This project was completed as part of Carnegie Mellon University’s 05-619: Data Visualization course. Its goal was to gain familiarity with implementing interactive visualization techniques using Svelte and D3, while evaluating how effective these techniques are within a chosen data domain. In this case, air quality data across Pittsburgh-area monitoring stations.

npm install
```

3. **Start Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Design Rationale
When approaching this assignment, I began by referencing Professor Moritz’s GitHub repositories from our in-class live coding sessions (e.g., FullSVGBarChart.svelte) and previous lab assignments. These examples helped me understand Svelte’s reactivity model and how to structure visualizations using SVGs and D3 scales.




## Technologies Used
- Svelte 5 - UI framework
